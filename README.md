This repository contains the just the code, data withheld, used to perform an quantitative analysis of anonymous grocery transactions.

In the latter half of the analysis I go deeper into actually using the massive dataset to develop a sequential retrieval model from Tensorflow recommenders, with the purpose of creating a ranking system for product recommendations. More detail on the the model is within markdown cells in the notebook.

PDF and ipynb version of the Jupyter notebook are both available.
